Please translate ALL 11 test cases using your SKILL agent logic:

For EACH test case:
1. Agent 1 (EN→FR): Translate the misspelled English to French
   - Use context to infer correct words from misspellings
   - Produce natural, grammatically correct French

2. Agent 2 (FR→HE): Translate the French to Hebrew
   - Semantic translation (not word-by-word)
   - Proper Hebrew grammar and syntax

3. Agent 3 (HE→EN): Translate the Hebrew back to English
   - This is the final output to compare with original
